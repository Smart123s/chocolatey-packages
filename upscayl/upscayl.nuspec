#### Free and Open Source AI Image Upscaler

# FAQ ðŸ¤“

- How does Upscayl work?
  - Upscayl uses AI models to enhance your images by guessing what the details could be. It uses Real-ESRGAN (and more in the future) model to achieve this.
- Is there a CLI available?
  - The CLI tool is called real-esrgan-ncnn-vulkan and it's available on the Real-ESRGAN repository.
- Do I need a GPU for this to work?
  - Yes, unfortunately. NCNN Vulkan requires a Vulkan compatible GPU. Upscayl won't work on most iGPUs or CPUs.
- How can I contribute?
  - You can donate more NCNN compatible models or fix code by submitting PRs :)
- You are not fully open source!!ðŸ˜¡
  - We are, we're using completely free and open source tech. We do ship a binary but that's because not including it would kill the entire purpose of the project. If you want to deal with all those PyTorch, NCNN, and Python errors, you're more than welcome to compile your own binary using the code provided by Real-ESRGAN. The binary is pre-compiled for convenience, if you do not trust it, then you can compile your own since everything is free and open source here :)

Upscayl uses Real-ESRGAN-ncnn-vulkan binaries to upscale images. More models and algorithms will come soon.
