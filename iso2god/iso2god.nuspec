    <description>ISO2GOD is a Windows utility originally written by KrK which allows conversion of original Xbox and Xbox 360 .isos into a Games on Demand container. This is useful, as playing game backups directly on the console requires either a GoD container or extracted files. GoD containers can be preferable over extracted files, as they don't have compatibility issues with some games and can be transferred quicker due to having a few large files instead of a large amount of tiny files. They will also be listed in the Microsoft dashboards, as they are the official format used for retail games from the marketplace.
