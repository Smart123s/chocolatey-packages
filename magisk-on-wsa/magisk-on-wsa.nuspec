### Build sources

LSPosed no longer provides builds via GitHub Actions in their official repository (as their original repository was shut down due to abousng GitHub Actions), so a reliable fork by Hoàng Gia Bảo is used instead. Releases are built using GitHub actions so they couldn't be altered before publishing.

#### Package updates

New versions of this package are published automatically via the `update.ps1` script (viewable in the package source on GitHub).</description>
