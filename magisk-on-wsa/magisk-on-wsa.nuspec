    <description># NOTICE: Build sources

LSPosed no longer provides builds via GitHub Actions in their official repository (as their original repository was shut down because it supposedly abused GitHub Actions), so I (the magisk-on-wsa chocolatey package maintainer) created a simple script that builds the latest versions of MagiskOnWsaLocal using GitHub actions. You can verify that the builds were not altered before publishing by viewing the action runs' logs at https://github.com/Smart123s/MagiskOnWSARemote.
