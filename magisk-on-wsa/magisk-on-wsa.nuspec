### Build sources

Downloading artifacts from GitHub without authentication is not allowed, so a third party redirector, called nightly.link generates the download links for the package. The files are downloaded directly from GitHub's servers.
Builds created in the main LSposed/MagiskOnWSA repo can be outdated, so some developer's forks are also used as a build source. These devs are members of the LSPosed organization on GitHub. For details, see `update.ps1`, as described in the next section.

#### Package updates

New versions of this package are published automatically via the `update.ps1` script (viewable in the package source on GitHub).</description>
