    <summary>The simplest way to use the next-generation private digital currency Monero, at the sweet spot between security, convenience, and features</summary>
    <description>## ‚ö° Lightweight &amp; Efficient
We put design first and ironed out the technical details of using digital money, so you can get back to business.
      
There's no Monero blockchain node to run. The MyMonero server does the heavy lifting for free. Forget spending days syncing the blockchain from your phone while waiting in line to pay for coffee. Get your entire transfer history instantly on any device with only your seed words.

##  üîè Be Your Own Bank
Send funds from anywhere, to anywhere, anytime.
No bank fees, no processing delays, no holds‚Äîever.

MyMonero is safe and secure. The server can't withdraw funds on your behalf because your spend key never leaves your computer.

##  ü§ì Smart
A built-in rolodex keeps your private addresses, payment IDs, and yes, even OpenAlias addresses in order.

##  üòé  Native Privacy
We take privacy and security seriously: we support Monero natively because it maintains the strongest privacy technology in any digital currency.

MyMonero was founded in 2014 by Monero project steward Riccardo Spagni (aka fluffypony) and was developed with the assistance of the Monero Core Team.

Our developers are Monero core contributors and our apps are all open source on GitHub.

Your app data is saved locally under strong encryption and only your "view key" is shared with the server. We keep no logs. You can also connect to your own server under Preferences.
